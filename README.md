# Machine-Learning-Real-estate-prediction-model
Machine Learning Real estate prediction model 

Designed a real estate price prediction tool in Jupyter Lab Environment that will accept the estimate house size and predict the price. 
Tools used include: python, jupyterlab, pandas, numpy, matplotlub, sklearn.

Data was pulled from kaggle.com which sourced this specific data from realestate.com.\

The following are detailed steps required to install and use the application:
1. Ensure the following is installed on your computer:
a. Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/)
2. Make sure the following files are located on your desktop to ensure they are easy to find: C964_version1.ipynb, realtor-data3.csv
3. Install Anaconda and update accordingly.
4. Open Anaconda and Launch “JupyterLab”
5. From there use the left navigation tab to open the following files by double clicking
them: C964_version1.ipynb, realtor-data3.csv
6. From here click the c964_versio1.ipynb tab and click the “restart Kernal and run all cells
button”: Allow 120 seconds for the program to run in order to build visuals and the prediction model.
7. From here you can scroll down to view all visuals regarding the real estate data, such as:
the bar graph showing the number of homes per price, the scatter plot showing the
relation of price to home size and the linear regression scatter plot that is utilized in the
machine learning prediction model.
8. At the bottom of the page you will see a user interface that allows you to use a slider bar
to input the approximate home size of the property you are interested in. After you use
the slide bar to select a home size you will click “Predict Price” and an estimated price
will be produced.
